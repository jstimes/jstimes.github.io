      <description>&lt;p&gt;My cumulative experience at Iowa State University has strongly prepared me for a career in software engineering. My class experience has provided me with the problem solving skills to impact engineering solutions. Classes such as Project Management and Software Architecture have shaped my abilities to design systems and develop them efficiently. While working on team projects I have utilized technical communication skills. Freedom of project choice in classes has allowed me to pursue the learning of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My General Education Reflections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My General Education electives have played a role in shaping my professional engineering skills. Some elective course I&amp;rsquo;ve taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Religions&lt;br&gt;
US History&lt;br&gt;
Linear Algebra&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My short term future goal is to obtain a software development role at a technology company. My long term goal is to manage a team of developers at a top technology company. I believe that my elective courses have given me the skills necessary to lead and interact with a development team. They have influenced my communication and analytical skills, and have already helped me out in classes, particularly project management. In that class, we were required to write project proposals containing details on the project&amp;rsquo;s significance and social impact, as well as economic details regarding the budget and other constraints. My elective courses assisted in my analysis of a project&amp;rsquo;s economic and social impacts, as well as in the consideration of ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also used knowledge from my general elective courses in my senior design course. For this class, my team has been required to discuss the benefits, risks, and other information regarding our project. My general elective courses have improved my ability to assess risks of projects and think about potential impacts to both users and non-users of a product, due to my understanding and study of similar situations in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My elective courses have provided me with a significant amount of insight into past events, issues, and solutions from a global context. I believe that studying history&amp;rsquo;s problems and solutions, both societal and technological, can provide someone with the ability to produce innovative solutions to a variety of problems. Meshing technical engineering skills and general electives-based innovation gives today&amp;rsquo;s engineers the ability to create both intelligent and ethical solutions to the world&amp;rsquo;s problems.&lt;/p&gt;
